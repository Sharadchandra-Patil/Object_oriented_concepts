Which of the following statements is correct?

    1.A reference is useful, when we intend to change the values of actual arguments through the function call.
    2.A reference is useful, when we want to save memory by preventing the ceation of large structure variable that are        being passed to the function.

What will be the output of the following C++ code?
#include<iostream>
#include<stdlib.h>
using namespace std;
class Test
{
	public:
		Test()
		{
			cout << "Constructor called";
		}
};
int main()
{
	Test *t = (Test *) malloc(sizeof(Test));
    return 0;
}
1. Constructor called
2. Constructor will not be called      //<--Ans
3. Compiler Error
4. Runtime error

Which of the following statements are correct in context of below code in C++?

#include<iostream>
#include<stdlib.h>
using namespace std;
int main( void )
{
    int *p = malloc(10);
}
Answers
1. It will allocate memory for 10 integer variables in the heap section consecutively.
2. Compile time error   //<--Ans
3. It will allocate memory for one integer variable in the heap section and memory will be initialized with 10 value.
4. Runtime error


10. 
If we dynamically allocate memory for one dimensional array using new operator as follows
 
#include<iostream>
#include<stdlib.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	int i;
	int *ptr=new int[4];
	for(i=0;i<4;i++)
        ptr[i]=i;

	for(i=0;i<4;i++)
		cout<<ptr[i]<<" ";

	return 0;
}

Then which of the following is the correct syntax for free that memory?
Answers
1. for(int i=0;i<4;++i)     delete ptr[i];    ptr=NULL;
2. free(ptr);    ptr=NULL;
3. delete[] ptr;    ptr=NULL;
4. Both A and C
5. Only C  is correct     //<--Ans
